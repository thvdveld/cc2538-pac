#[doc = "AES_KEY3_2 / AES_KEY2_6 Third Key / Second Key (internal, but clearable) The following registers are not accessible through the host for reading and writing. They are used to store internally calculated key information and intermediate results. However, when the host performs a write to the any of the respective AES_KEY2_n or AES_KEY3_n addresses, respectively the whole 128-bit AES_KEY2_n or AES_KEY3_n register is cleared to 0s. The AES_GHASH_H_IN_n registers (required for GHASH, which is part of GCM) are mapped to the AES_KEY2_n registers. The (intermediate) authentication result for GCM and CCM is stored in the AES_KEY3_n register.\n\nYou can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`aes_key3_2::W`](W).
