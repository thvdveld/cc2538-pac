If a bit in the GPIOCR register is 0, the data being written to the corresponding bit in the AFSEL register is not committed and retains its previous value. If a bit in the GPIOCR register is set to 1, the data being written to the corresponding bit of the AFSEL register is committed to the register and will reflect the new value.

Any write to the commit register causes the lock register to be locked.\n\nYou can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`gpiocr::R`](R).
