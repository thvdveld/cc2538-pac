#[doc = "I2C master control and status This register accesses status bits when read and control bits when written. When read, the status register indicates the state of the I2C bus controller. When written, the control register configures the I2C controller operation. The START bit generates the START or REPEATED START condition. The STOP bit determines if the cycle stops at the end of the data cycle or continues on to a repeated START condition. To generate a single transmit cycle, the I2C master slave address (I2CMSA) register is written with the desired address, the R/S bit is cleared, and this register is written with ACK = X (0 or 1), STOP = 1, START = 1, and RUN = 1 to perform the operation and stop. When the operation is completed (or aborted due an error), an interrupt becomes active and the data may be read from the I2CMDR register. When the I2C module operates in master receiver mode, the ACK bit is normally set, causing the I2C bus controller to automatically transmit an acknowledge after each byte. This bit must be cleared when the I2C bus controller requires no further data to be transmitted from the slave transmitter.\n\nYou can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`stat::R`](R).
