#[doc = "GPTM Timer A This register shows the current value of the Timer A counter. When a GPTM is configured to one of the 32-bit modes, TAR appears as a 32-bit register (the upper 16-bits correspond to the contents of the GPTM Timer B (TBR) register). In the16-bit Input edge count, input edge time, and PWM modes, bits \\[15:0\\]
contain the value of the counter and bits 23:16 contain the value of the prescaler, which is the upper 8 bits of the count. Bits \\[31:24\\]
always read as 0. To read the value of the prescaler in 16-bit, one-shot and periodic modes, read bits \\[23:16\\]
in the TAV register.\n\nYou can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`tar::R`](R). See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api)."]
